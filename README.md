## How to reproduce our results
We recommend running our project on a [docker](https://hub.docker.com) container making use of [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) once it has been cloned.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will generate three containers
- **`gluetun`**. [Gluetun VPN Client](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) for region selection using almost-any VPN provider on the market. You will need to generate a folder `secrets` with 2 files for your VPN credentials. `vpn_user.txt` and `vpn_pass.txt`.
- **`carbolytics_db`**. PostgreSQL 13.4 for long-term storage of the cookies crawled.
- **`crawl`**. [OpenWPM](https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM) container with modiffied options for this project.
